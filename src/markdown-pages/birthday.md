### LOCKDOWN BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.

Its my 20th birthday and I am glad that all my family members and friends are safe. 

I got many gifts even during this lockdown.
My dad bought me a beard trimmer and it was a great surprise on my birthday,
My mom made a chocolate cake, it was delicious and yummy, and I got snacks and sweets from my grandpa and grandma.
